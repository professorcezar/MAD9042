He still finds it amazing that those tools and systems from NeXT have turned into Xcode and that he can now write apps that run on his watch. Prior to NeXT, Steve was a network administrator for Indiana University and the University of Waterloo, where he obtained both a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Math, which he now concedes is way more math than you actually need to know.
